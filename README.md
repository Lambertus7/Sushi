# Welcome Reader to the (possible) Sushi website

_In this md file, you will be brought up to speed what is; what will come to be; and the why behind it all for this sushi website._

## The Structure

### Pages

**_Home_**<br>
The Homepage is where the user ( <sub>customer</sub>) will have a fun little button to click to start going through all of the orders. On this very same homepage, there will be a sign in button in the bottom-right corner of the screen. This will redirect the user to the backoffice sign in page, it will look spiffy! Have a look at CSS description.

**_Catalog_**<br>
This page will provide the user (<sub>customer</sub>) with an overview of all the available dishes and maybe even promotions that is going on. <br> This page will have a navigation bar to select from the most popular items to the chef's special; in between you will have all the categories the different items fall under so that the customer have an easier way to search. It may even have a possible search button should the customer already know what he/she may want to order. Behind every item, there will be increment and decrement button. In the description of every item there will be an icon(s) to indicate the type of allergen and if it is a vegeterian item or not; what type of protein for said item may also be indicated via a icon (think about a pork, fish, chicken and cow). <br> This is the page where the user will have a basket in the bottom-right corner to check on their orders. This may possibly be a modal dialog instead of making a whole page, this is for performance purposes, and it looks nicer tihi. <br>
...<br>
<br>
**_Order Overview_**<br>
In this modal dialog, you will have your set of orders with its corresponding amount for each item and its prices; showing the grand total at the end. It may even be possible to increase or decrease particular items so that the customer does not need to close the dialog window and have to search for the item individually.

### Design

The idea is to have a minimilistic design but with some icons giving everything its flare, so to speak. For example,there will be some cute sushi icons in the mix. Definitely to indicate whether or not something is vegeterian or not. Maybe have cat sushi chef as the background of the modal dialog window(?) and or next to the order button.

**_Color_**<br>
The background color will be either a black or white. If white, the font color will black with maybe one or two phrases being red. This may be to indicate the spicy level of the item in question or what type of diet it beongs to. <br>
<br>
**_Icons_**
Each icon will be different, that means the color will be different; the meaning itself and the possibly the size will be the same throughout the whole website.
